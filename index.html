    <h2>Stand up and shout</h2>
    <p1>It's the same old song<br>
    You've gotta be somewhere at sometime<br>
    They never let you fly</p1><br>
    <p1>It's like broken glass<br>
    You get cut before you see it<br>
    So open up your eyes</p1><br>
    <p>You've got desire<br>
    So let it out<br>
    You've got the power<br>
    Stand up and shout, shout<br>
    Stand up and shout, shout</p><br>
    <p>You've got wings of steel<br>
    But they never really move you<br>
    You only seem to crawl</p><br>
    <p>You've been nailed to the wheel<br>
    But never really turning<br>
    You know you've got to want it all</p><br>
    <p>You've got desire<br>
    So let it out<br>
    You've got the power<br>
    Stand up and shout, shout<br>
    Stand up and shout<br>
    Let it out</p><br>
    <p>You are the strongest chain<br>
    And not just some reflection<br>
    So never hide again</p><br>
    <p>You are the driver<br>
    You own the road<br>
    You are the fire go on explode</p><br>
    <p>You've got desire<br>
    So let it out<br>
    You've got the power<br>
    Stand up and shout<br>
    Stand up and shout<br>
    Let it out<br>
    Stand up and shout</p><br>

<h2>Holy Diver</h2>
<p>Mmmmhhh mhmm, yeah yeah<br>
Holy diver<br>
You've been down too long in the midnight sea<br>
Oh what's becoming of me</p><br>
<p>Ride the tiger<br>
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean<br>
Oh don't you see what I mean</p><br>
<p>Gotta get away<br>
Holy diver</p><br>
<p>Shiny diamonds<br>
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue<br>
Something is coming for you<br>
Look out</p><br>
<p>Race for the morning<br>
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light<br>
Oh we will pray it's all right</p><br>
<p>Gotta get away, get away</p><br>
<p>Between the velvet lies<br>
There's a truth that's hard as steel<br>
The vision never dies<br>
Life's a never ending wheel</p><br>
<p>Holy diver<br>
You're the star of the masquerade<br>
No need to look so afraid</p><br>
<p>Jump, jump<br>
Jump on the tiger<br>
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean<br>
Some light can never be seen, yeah</p><br>
<p>Holy diver<br>
You've been down too long in the midnight sea<br>
Oh what's becoming of me<br>
No, no</p><br>
<p>Ride the tiger<br>
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean<br>
Oh don't you see what I mean</p><br>
<P>Gotta get away, get away<br>
Gotta get away, get away<br>
Holy diver, soul survivor<br>
You' re the one whose clean<br>
Holy diver, holy diver<br>
Never come to knew, coming after you<br>
Holy diver<br>
Holy diver, yeah</P><br>
<p>Alright, get away, get away, get away<br>
Holy diver, holy diver, holy diver mmhhmmm</p><br>
